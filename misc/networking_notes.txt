Because networking is such a vast topic, I decided to take some notes on what I know about the Linux networking subsystem.

In the Linux networking subsystem there is ONE key structure: the socket buffer or sk_buff (Often further shortened to skb). 
The reason why it is the key structure is because it literally IS the packet. This structure is passed between the various layers
of the OSI model is manipulated accordingly.

Due to the vastness and diversity of networking standards, devices, and protocols you would expect the skb to be fucking massive. And,
you would be right! It is probably one of the largest structures in the Linux Kernel (behind something like task_struct).
