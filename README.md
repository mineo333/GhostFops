# Qogchamp

Qogchamp is a Linux Kernel post exploitation module whose objective is to create a remote shell in kernelspace.

As of this writing, the rootkit is largely complete with only a few features remaining (i.e. process hiding).

For information on how this rootkit functions reference my [blog](https://mineo333.dev) or the docs folder.
